## In this phase of the project, I will use NIST 800-61 Incident Handling Guide and work through several Alerts created by MS Sentinel.

## Further investigation revealed (as documented in my Incident Notes) that incidents 66 and 47 were from the same ip address along with several other Brute Force attempts.  The indication was that the Host VM was suffering from overexposure to inbound traffic and the Firewall (NSG) may be misconfigured.  

## Using the same procedure, I worked through all the alerts in preparation for the Eradication & Recovery phase of the process. 
> [!NOTE]  
> ### (Because this is a HoneyNet and both VMs are isolated from any other network systems, I was not concerned that some of the Brute Force attempts were successful.)
